In This program, my colleauges and I created this CLI Program from scratch in C++ to show our strong grasp of the basics of C++ language.

This Program ask the user for 2 choices either input the daily power consumption in watts directly, or prompt him/her to an interactive window where the user can calculate his/her daily power consumption.

It is important to note, this program does not include various factors that decide the actual requirments for one's house due to the time limits we had we were not able to implement said features like tempretures and wiring. SO this program does not give accurate takes nor it can replace professional's opinion. 

If you are a uni student and picked a similar topic to build your project on feel free to take snippets from this code that may or may not help you and save you lots of time.

Happy codding!
